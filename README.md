Some personal scripts that I use to manage my Beat Saber custom songs library

Includes 3 scripts:
- `src/downloader.py` - Downloads songs that match some criteria from Beat Saver
- `src/check.py` - Checks the songs of a directory and creates a csv with stats per song
- `src/prune.py` - Prunes the songs of a directory that don't match some criteria
